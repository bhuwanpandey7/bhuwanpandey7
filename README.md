Outstanding work history in an agile context, including participation in requirement gathering, calls for requirement refinement, sprint planning, story pointing, work demonstration, and reflection.

JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS3, SASS, ag-grid, Angular, React, Angular Material, Bootstrap, HTML5, jQuery, Jasmine, Karma, Jest, HighCharts, Chart.js, RxJS, Git, BitBucket, and Gitlab's CI CD are some of my technical prowess.

If your tech stack includes something new that I'm not familiar with, I'm delighted to learn it and understand the ideas in the shortest amount of time feasible. I'm also eager to use my ten years of learning to contribute something new to the team.
